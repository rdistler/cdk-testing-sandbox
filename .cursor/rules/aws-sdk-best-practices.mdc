- Use the modular imports to reduce bundle size (e.g., `import { S3Client } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3"` instead of `import * as AWS from 'aws-sdk'`)
- Implement proper error handling and retries using the `retry` middleware
- Use environment variables or a configuration service to manage AWS credentials
- Leverage the AWS SDK v3's middleware stack for custom request/response processing
- Implement proper pagination when dealing with AWS services that return large datasets
