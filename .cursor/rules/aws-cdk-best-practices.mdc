- Always use the latest version of cdk
- Always prefer using ContainerImage.fromAsset() over manually managing ECR repositories when possible
- Use higher-level constructs like ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService instead of creating individual resources
- Use constructs to encapsulate reusable infrastructure components
- Implement proper separation of concerns with stacks
- Leverage CDK's built-in testing capabilities
- Use environment-agnostic code with context lookups
- Implement proper IAM role and policy management
- Utilize CDK Pipelines for CI/CD integration
- Utilize Typescript language
- Follow test driven development practices when developing CDK solutions
- Use stage constructs
